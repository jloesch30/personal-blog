# Project Overview 
The goal of this project is to create a IOS application (of which I have little to no experience with)
and deploy it to the App Store. For the client side application, I will either be using React Native or Swift after
a bit more research; for the backend, I will use a Rust API (as Rust is something I have been practicing for a while and
would like to create a projects using that knowledge). 

# The Why?
This project was inspired by a non-profit event I have volunteered with for over a decade; the event is called
The Wild West Brew Fest of which is food/drinks festival to raise money for local communities. To date, the Wile West Brew Fest
has been able to give back over 1 Million dollars, and is continuously growing in size and expanding to different cities. As of now,
the Brew Fest does not have a mobile application, nor a website that can be used during the event to help patrons navigate the festival. Because of this,
I thought a mobile application could be useful to drive both patron experience and also lower friction to raise money through application transactions.
