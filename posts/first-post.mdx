### Hello there
<br />
This is the first post of hopefully many to come; so I think the first thing in order is to introduce myself. My name is Josh Loesch, an Austin, Texas resident working in the financial industry as a Full-Stack Software Engineer. My life consists of writing code, planning a wedding (I’m engaged!) and pressing on to courageously walk the cloudy paths of life. Writing has always been a challenge to me, as I find myself pondering just the “right” thing to say at times; but over the years, I have found that writing is special as it does not require the idea of “right.” It is an expressionist medium just like canvas or photography consisting of line heights and various fonts. I tend to write with the expectation of looking back on my works and entering into the same line of consciousness I was in when conducting the works.
<br />
So let’s talk about the future writings; my hope is to categorize each work into its respective domain. I am passionate for continuous education and becoming an expert in domains so some works will be quite technical while others will remain practical. Along with technology, I dabble in photography, motivational writing and abstract writing and plan to post some works in this line as well. 
<br />
Overall, thank you for being here and I hope you find the content of my page useful and enjoyable. I look forward to sharing this journey with the world and to look back on what I learn throughout time.
