# Welcome to my page
<br/>
**Glad you are here!** This repository is designed to hold a collection of writings and projects
that I hope to share with others. I am a software engineer by trade, but I have a passion for continued
enducation and learning an array of topics that may not be directly related to my profession. I hope you find
the contents of this website useful and interesting. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to
connect with me on LinkedIn, or use the contact form on this website. Happy coding!
